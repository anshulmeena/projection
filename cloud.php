					Cloud computing has been changing how most people use the web and how they store their files. It&rsquo;s 
					the structure that runs sites like Facebook, Amazon and Twitter and the core that allows us to take 
					advantage of services like Google Docs and Gmail.

          	To understand how does cloud computing work, imagine that the cloud consists of layers — mostly the back-end layers 
          	and the front-end or user-end layers. The front-end layers are the ones you see and interact with. When you access 
          	your email on Gmail for example, you are using software running on the front-end of a cloud. The same is true when 
          	you access your Facebook account. The back-end consists of the hardware and the software architecture that fuels the 
          	interface you see on the front end.
          </p>
          <p>
          	Because the computers are set up to work together, the applications can take advantage of all that computing power as 
          	if they were running on one particular machine. Cloud computing also allows for a lot of flexibility. Depending on the 
          	demand, you can increase how much of the cloud resources you use without the need for assigning specific hardware for 
          	the job, or just reduce the amount of resources assigned to you when they are not necessary.

				Will it change the way we use computers?
			</h3>
			<p>
				The transition from being very ‘personal hardware dependent’ to a world where resources are shared among the masses 
				is creeping up on us slowly and unobtrusively. Very many people have already transitioned to using a cloud environment 
				for most of their time in front of the computer without even realizing it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sure, most of us still use some version of Microsoft Office or Quickbooks that was installed on our computers, but 
				even those kinds of software are now offering an online version that can be used instead. The possibility of being 
				able to access your data and software wherever you need it makes this transition very appealing to most people.
			</p>
			<p>
				Are there problems with this concept? Of course there are. If for some reason your internet goes down, your access 
				to your data also disappears. There are security concerns with the data and the risk that companies will use 
				proprietary formats for the files and that require that you pay for a certain service monthly or you may lose 
				access to your own data permanently.
